How to create a standalone execution file:

-type in "mcc -m LMK_gettingStarted.m" in your command window
-note: no "addpath 'folder'" commands should be in your m-file

-then an LMK_gettingStarted.exe and LMK_gettingStarted.prj is created

-to add relevant matlab folders containing relevant m-files:
	-double click on LMK_gettingStarted.prj
	-chose "add files/directories"
	
    Classes
    GUI
    Helper
    Preferences
    Wrapper

-When finished click on "Build" (upper right corner of the window)

	-this works much easier than "mcc -m LMK_gettingStarted -a ./folder because
	 sometimes matlab has problems to add the folder

-the LMK_gettingStarted.exe is needed for your standalone application

Before using on your computer without MATLAB:

-you have to install the MCRInstaller is needed for running this application
-get it from mathworks.com (free)
